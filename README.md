Common Lisp Library of Linear Algebra

*This is still under alpha version!*

## What is this?
This library provides suites of calculatins for linear algebra like [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) or [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). The aims of this library are

* to provide sufficiently fast library of linear algebra for Lispers
* to explore the capability of linear algebra calculations **not** to use foreign function interface (FFI)

## Requirements
* Intel X86-64
* SBCL (>= 1.4.15)
