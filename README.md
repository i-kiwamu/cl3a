Common Lisp Library of Linear Algebra

## What is this?
This library provides suites of calculatins for linear algebra like [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) or [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). The aim of this library is

* to provide fast library of linear algebra for Lispers
* to explore the capability of linear algebra calculations written in **pure Common Lisp**
